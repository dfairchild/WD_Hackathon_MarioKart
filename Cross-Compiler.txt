Since Tim whined about it, here's the steps to Cross-Compile on Windows.

- Download "Eclipse for C/C++ Developers" here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
- Set your workspace to <GitDirectory>/WD_Hackathon_MarioKart/source/
- Go to File->Import...->General->Existing Projects into Workspace->Next
- Set the root directory to Hackathon_Eclipse and make sure the project shows up in the box below where you set the directory.
- Click Finish.
- Compile that bitch.
